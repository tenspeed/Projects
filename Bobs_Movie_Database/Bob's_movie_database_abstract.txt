Write a program for Bob that will let him create a database of all his movies. The program will eventually have a GUI but for now will run in the terminal. Bob should be able to add movies and include information such as 'Title', 'Genre', 'Year', 'Director', 'Actors', etc. (or leave some of the information blank if he so chooses), delete movies, edit existing movie information, search for specific movies by any of the information provided, and view his entire library sorted by title (in alphabetical order), year (from newest to oldest), director, etc. The movie information should be stored in a text file for the time being and prompt Bob to make a new save file if it's his first time running the program.

The movies will be stored in a text file as a long string which will need to be parsed into a 2D list. The basic information should be ordered as [['Title', 'Genre', 'Director', 'Year', 'Actors'], [...]]; where 'Actors' could be any number of entries. There will always be 4 entries before the 'Actors' info though.
